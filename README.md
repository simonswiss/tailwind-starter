Time to design in the browser and create something awesome with [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com)!

This starter kit gives you a [browser-sync dev server](https://browsersync.io), which comes pretty handy. Everytime you save a HTML file, your browser will inject new styles / reload the page for your convenience, so you can focus on what you're creating.

Go ahead and build something cool!

### How to get started?

1. Clone this repo
2. `yarn` or `npm install` to install the required dependencies
3. Customise the `tailwind.js` config file (only if needed!)
4. `gulp` to kickoff the dev server, and open your browser window
5. Edit `index.html` in `./dist/` and start creating!

If you make changes to the tailwind config, you may need to stop and restart the browser-sync server for changes to apply.

**Have fun!** 🎉
